This website is the final project for Web Development II, of Laissa Kethllin.

to develop this project, I used a landing page bootstrap template containing all the html, css and javascript files retrieved from https://startbootstrap.com/theme/freelancer. 
You can see the original website on this link: https://startbootstrap.com/previews/freelancer.

I started changing the content itself, putting my info and images. After that, I started moving the structure to fit my needs.
The main change regarding this was to add a button to some of my projects into the pop-up portfolio container.

After that, I started changing the roots colors for my project. I wanted the portfolio to have my moodboard colors.

When the design was good enough for me, I started completing the "alt" section regarding the images, and committed the changes to validate my code on Wave and W3C CSS and HTML.
