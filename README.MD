This website is the final project for Web Development II, of Laissa Kethllin.

to develop this project, I used a landing page bootstrap template containing all the html, css and javascript files retrieved from https://startbootstrap.com/theme/freelancer. 
You can see the original website on this link: https://startbootstrap.com/previews/freelancer.

I started changing the content itself, putting my info and images. After that, I started moving the structure to fit my needs.
The main change regarding this was to add a button to some of my projects into the pop-up portfolio container.

After that, I started changing the roots colors for my project. I wanted the portfolio to have my moodboard colors.
Another css library I have used was the animate.css. I have installed the extension and put the link rel on the head on my website. The animations I used were bounce and pulse.

When the design was good enough for me, I started completing the "alt" section regarding the images, and committed the changes to validate my code on Wave and W3C CSS and HTML.
Html was fine, mine mistakes such as spaces between words in img tags, that were corrected. The CSS I changed did not contain any mistake. However, the Wave Checker indicated 3 errors about empty links. These links were empty because they were social media icons.

Considering that the original code contains a lot of complex selectors and tags, I have put in an .doc file only the parts I have changed. The document can be found in the root of this project as well.
